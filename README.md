# Booking App Backend

#This project is created using java and springboot. It uses MySql database for storing the information.
#This project is currently having 4 tables which deals with user registration(2 tables), train details(1 table), and Booking Details(1 table).
#Referencing between the tables also exist among these tables.

# This project consists of 4 features:
1. User Registration:- Through this,, user can be registered in the system
2. Add Train:- Through this endpoint, user can add trains in the system
3. Get Seat Availability:- Through this, user can check whether the train has sufficient seats available
4. Book a seat:- Though this, user can book a seat in the train.

 # Some tasks that are missing:
 1. User Login
 2. Getting Speicific Booking Details

# How To Use:
1. Setup Java, maven in the system
2. Setup mysql database
3. Install postman for running the api
4. Change your local username and password of mysql and paste in "application.properties" file in the project folder

# Reason for not able to accomplish remaining tasks:
1. I was not able to spend sufficient time on this project due to some unforeseen circumstances. However, I quite liked the task.

# Thanks
